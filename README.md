GoogleTasksWidget-android
=========================

Back in the day, Google Tasks did not have an Android widget or a public API, creating much consternation for folks (myself included) who couldn't access their tasks on an Android device.

This was one of the few solutions early on, and surprisingly sold some copies despite its relative awfulness.

Since hopelessly out of date (circa beginning of 2011), but hopefully provides some insight about how authentication to Google services worked without the pleasantness of a client library.
